The origininal dataset RSNA Pneumonia requires locating the lung opacity region in chest X-ray.\
We adapt this dataset for a binary classification of Normal vs Lung Opacity.\
We train a classifier, then test its performance on locating the anomaly region.

We studied 2 protocols to assess systematically the attention heatmaps generated by GradCAM.\
The 1st protocol assess the trustworthiness of the attention heatmap with proportion inside bounding box (follwing GradCAM).\

The 2nd protocol measure trustworthiness by Intersection Over Union of annotated and predicted bounding box.\
The predicted bounding box is defined as the smallest rectangle holding at leats 95% of activation (following ProtoPNet).\

The Intersection Over Union protocol appears to be the better one among the two.\
Nevertheless, this protocol still has some flaws. \
The major problem to address is how to convert attention heatmap to predicted bounding box.\
