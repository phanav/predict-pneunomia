<h1>Data</h1>
<p>The original dataset is RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge 2018 ([5]RSNA, 2018). This dataset contains publicly available chest X-ray from the NIH (National Institutes of Health).</p>
<p>In our dataset provided,there are around 9000 unique patients for each of the 2 classes: lung opacity and normal. The number of images is higher, because a patient may have several images. For valid and test phases, we reserve for evaluation a subset of 1000 patients for each of the class (4000 in total for evaluation out of 18 000). Images are sized in&nbsp;512 x 512 px.</p>
